This C program is a simple **Smart Canteen Billing System** that handles multiple customers, processes their food orders, applies discounts, and calculates total revenue.
It performs the following key functions:

* Prompts the user to enter the **total number of customers** to be served.
* For each customer, it takes the **name** and **number of items purchased**.
* Displays a **fixed menu** with item codes and prices for selection.
* Allows the user to input **item code** and **quantity**, then calculates the **total price** for each item.
* Computes the **total bill** for each customer and applies a **10% discount** if the bill exceeds ₹500.
* Displays the **final bill amount** for every customer.
* After all customers are processed, it shows a **canteen summary** including the total customers served and the **total revenue collected**.

Overall, the program efficiently simulates a small-scale canteen billing process using loops, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations in C.
